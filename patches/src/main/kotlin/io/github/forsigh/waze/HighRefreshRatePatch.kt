/**
 * Let Waze run on a high-refresh-rate display.
 *
 * Waze chooses the display mode for its own surface and deliberately refuses anything above 60 Hz: the
 * mode-picker in `com/waze/utils/o` (`RefreshRateDisplayListener`) floors the candidate mode's refresh
 * rate, compares it against 60, and rejects the mode above it -
 *
 *     const-wide/high16 v10, 0x404e000000000000L   # 60.0
 *     cmpl-double v6, v6, v10
 *     if-lez v6, :cond_0
 *     ...
 *     const-string v5, "Ignoring mode with ID = %d. Refresh rate is too high: %.6f"
 *
 * - so a 120 Hz panel is served 60 Hz by Waze even though the system could go higher.
 *
 * This patch rewrites that ceiling constant from 60.0 to the requested rate. It is the *only* 60 Hz gate
 * that was found: the renderer's `frameRateLimiter` dependency carries flags, not a per-frame delay, and
 * no ms-per-frame constant exists in `com/waze/map/opengl`.
 *
 * Off by default on purpose: the 60 Hz ceiling is Waze's battery/heat decision, and forcing 120 Hz on a
 * phone that is already thermally throttled makes it hotter without looking smoother. Enable it, compare,
 * and lower [targetRefreshRate] if the device starts throttling.
