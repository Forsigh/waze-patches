/**
 * Auto zoom.
 *
 * Waze already ships this preference itself: `CONFIG_VALUE_ROUTING_AUTO_ZOOM` is a String config
 * whose settings row (`com/waze/settings/fh.smali`) cycles the values "no" / "yes" / "speed".
 * The map reads the same key as a StateFlow (`com/waze/map/gb.smali`).
 *
 * So this patch does not invent a feature - it pins the existing one. Hooking the READ getter
 * (rather than seeding a config file) is what makes the choice stick: Waze re-syncs config from
 * the server, which reverts a written value but cannot bypass a getter that returns ours.
