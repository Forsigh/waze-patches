/**
 * What the bundle wants to force, collected by the individual patches and applied centrally.
 *
 * Patches do NOT inject their own smali any more. Each one records its intent here; the single
 * `configOverridesPatch` emits ONE block per typed getter from the collected contents.
 *
 * Why this exists - stacking injections into one method corrupts the bytecode. A block's branch
 * targets are resolved when it is added, but inserting a later block at the same index shifts the
 * earlier one without relocating it. The result is branches pointing at the wrong instruction, which
 * the runtime verifier rejects (VerifyError: invalid branch target) and the app dies on startup.
 * Observed exactly: block two in com.waze.config.c.a() had every target off by the 12 code units of
 * the block inserted after it.
