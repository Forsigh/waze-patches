// No extension module: the in-app "Forsigh Settings" menu was removed before release, so the bundle
// ships patches only. Its sources, plus the Waze stubs they needed, are kept in ../parked/ - outside
// the build, so they are neither compiled nor packaged. If a runtime-toggle screen is ever built, the
// right surface is Waze's own boolean-config toggle section, not a custom row.
